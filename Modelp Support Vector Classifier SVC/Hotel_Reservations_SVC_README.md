# Hotel Reservations Support Vector Classifier

## Introduction
This project utilizes a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to classify hotel reservations based on the average price per room. The dataset contains a variety of features including the number of adults, number of children, type of meal plan, room type reserved, market segment type, and booking status.

## Why Support Vector Classifier?

### 1. Effective in High Dimensional Spaces
SVC is effective when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. It's also effective in cases where the dimensionality is not fixed, giving it good flexibility.

### 2. Kernel Trick
SVC can use the kernel trick to handle nonlinear data, which allows for complex decision boundaries.

### 3. Minimal Overfitting
With the use of the 'C' parameter, SVC allows for cost-sensitive learning and minimizes the risk of overfitting.

### 4. Clear Margin of Separation
SVC is known for finding a hyperplane that clearly separates classes, which is useful in classification tasks.

By taking into consideration these factors, the Support Vector Classifier is selected for this task as an alternative model for comparison.
