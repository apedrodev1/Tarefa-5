# Hotel Reservations Logistic Regression Classifier

## Introduction
This project utilizes a Logistic Regression Classifier to classify hotel reservations based on the average price per room. The dataset contains a variety of features including the number of adults, number of children, type of meal plan, room type reserved, market segment type, and booking status.

## Why Logistic Regression Classifier?

### 1. Simplicity and Interpretability
Logistic Regression is relatively simple to understand and interpret, making it a good choice for a baseline model.

### 2. Speed
Logistic Regression is computationally less expensive compared to other algorithms like Random Forest and SVC, making it faster for training and predictions.

### 3. Probabilistic Nature
Logistic Regression not only classifies but also provides probabilities associated with each class, offering some measure of confidence in the predictions.

### 4. Linearity Assumption
Logistic Regression works well when the classes can be linearly separable or nearly so. Although this is not always the case, it offers another angle to understand the data.

By considering these factors, Logistic Regression is selected for this task as a third alternative model for comparison.
