# Hotel Reservations - Gradient Boosting Model

## Choice of Model

The Gradient Boosting model was chosen as a secondary model for comparison against the previously trained Random Forest model. Here are the reasons for choosing Gradient Boosting:

### Robustness to Overfitting

Gradient Boosting is less prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with a dataset that isn't too large.

### Flexibility

The model can capture complex patterns in the data, which is beneficial given the variety of variables in our dataset.

### Feature Importance

Like Random Forest, the model also provides a way to evaluate the importance of each feature in the prediction, which can be useful for understanding the key drivers of room price.

### Comparative Analysis

Using a different model like Gradient Boosting allows for a comparative analysis against the Random Forest model to evaluate which model suits the data better.

### Performance

While the Gradient Boosting model may not be as fast as Random Forest for large datasets, its predictive performance is often superior, making it a good choice for our problem.

By comparing the results of both models, we can make a more informed decision on which model is better suited for predicting hotel room prices based on various features.
