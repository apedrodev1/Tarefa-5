# Hotel Reservations Random Forest Classifier

## Introduction
This project aims to classify hotel reservations based on their average price per room using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features like the number of adults, number of children, type of meal plan, room type reserved, market segment type, and booking status.

## Why Random Forest?

### 1. Handling Mixed Data Types
Random Forest is capable of handling a mix of numerical and categorical variables, which suits our dataset perfectly. Our dataset contains both types of variables, and Random Forest can process them without requiring extensive preprocessing.

### 2. Resistance to Overfitting
Random Forest models are generally robust against overfitting. This is crucial for achieving a model that generalizes well to unseen data.

### 3. Feature Importance
One of the advantages of using Random Forest is that it provides an easy way to evaluate feature importances. This is useful for understanding which variables are contributing the most to the prediction.

### 4. Flexibility
Random Forest is a flexible algorithm capable of capturing complex non-linear relationships in the data, which is beneficial for our diverse dataset.

### 5. Easy to Implement
Random Forest is relatively straightforward to implement and tune, making it a good choice for a first iteration of a machine learning model.

By considering these factors, Random Forest is selected as the model of choice for this classification task.
